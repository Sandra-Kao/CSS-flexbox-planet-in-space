      <h2 class="focus__title">Jupiter</h2>
      <p class="focus__paragraph">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass (more than) two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but (a little) less than one-thousandth
        the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because
        of its massive size.</p>

      <h2 class="focus__title">Earth</h2>
      <p class="focus__paragraph">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans,
        seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere.

      <p class="focus__paragraph">Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked
        eye in broad daylight.[17][18] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun.</p>

      <p class="focus__paragraph">Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god
        Hermes.
